Create a playlist with ${numberOfTracks} songs that:
1. Match the musical style and energy of the input songs
2. Include a mix of well-known and lesser-known tracks
3. Maintain a cohesive flow
4. Include only songs that exist (no made-up songs)

For each song, provide:
- Song name
- Artist name
- A brief (10 words max) explanation of why it fits

After generating all recommendations, analyze both the seed tracks and recommended songs together to create an engaging playlist name that:
1. Reflects the collective mood, era, genre, or theme
2. Captures the musical journey or progression
3. Is creative and memorable
4. Feels cohesive with all tracks, not just the seed songs

Your response must be a JSON object with exactly this structure:
{
  "playlistName": "Your Creative Playlist Name",
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "name": "Song Name",
      "artist": "Artist Name",
      "reason": "Brief explanation"
    }
  ]
}

Do not include any other properties in the JSON response. The array must be under the "recommendations" key.`;
